        "\n",
        "In this homework, you will write code that generates features for the positive/negative sentiment classification of movie\n",
        "reviews, and train a model on those features to predict the sentiment of new data. Example of selected movie reviews\n",
        "with labels:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Label | Review\n",
        "| :--- | :------\n",
        "| **pos** | What can I say, it’s a damn good movie. See it if you still haven’t. Great camera works and lighting <br> techniques. Awesome, just awesome.  Orson Welles is incredible ‘The Lady From Shanghai’ can certainly <br> take the place of ‘Citizen Kane’.\n",
        "| **neg** | Can I give this a minus rating? No? Well, let me say that this is the most atrocious film I have ever tried to <br> watch. It was Painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot(?) is well hidden in several sub-levels of <br> nebulosity. I rented this film with a friend and, after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better, we <br> decided to “fast forward” a little to see if things would get any better. It never gets better. This film about <br> some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls, sounds interesting, but, in reality, it is just a bore. <br> Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens. If you ever get the chance to watch this, do <br> yourself a favor, try “PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE” instead ”  \n",

        "This notebook contains code which performs all the data parsing, model training, and evaluation for you. Once you are in this notebook, **save a copy** in your Google Drive or Github before working on the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, a basic logistic regression model (from the scikit-learn package) is trained with your created features\n",
        "to predict each review’s sentiment. Your ultimate goal for this assignment is to featurize the text creatively and optimize\n",
        "the accuracy of the model on the test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your main tasks regarding *classification* are to **implement four features**:\n",
        "1. A bag of words feature. Fill out the **bag_of_words** function in the notebook to represent a document through its bag of words. Represent each **lowercase** word tokenized with the NLTK **word_tokenize** function through its binary value. Remember that the feature value for a word that shows up in a review should be 1, no matter how many times it is mentioned. Please keep your code between the **#BEGIN/#END SOLUTION** flags.\n",
        "2. Create **three** different classes of features. Implement them in the **feature1** **feature2** and **feature3** functions. Create features that you think would perform better than bag of words, and assess their independent performance on the development data. Describe your reasoning in your Colab notebook and include accuracy scores on the dev.txt data (printed in the Colab output). **You must report your reasoning and development scores in the table provided.** It is not required that your features actually perform well, but your justification and reasoning should be defensible. We are looking for thoughtful insights as to why your original features *should* outperform the simple bag of words implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more feature ideas consult [SLP Ch. 5](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/5.pdf) and lecture slides, and please do keep the following constraints in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Do not use pre-trained word vectors (including static embeddings like word2vec or contextual embeddings like BERT); we will cover these later.\n",
        "* Do not use the predictions of any other supervised model on this data as a feature for logistic regression (e.g., do not train a separate CNN on this data, make predictions on the dev data using the CNN, and then treat your CNN prediction as a feature).\n",
        "* Do not alter {train,dev,test}.txt or find additional sources of training data. This homework is focusing on how you *represent* your data, not other aspects of the training regime.\n",
        "* Do not import any other additional libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "After completing classificaion there is a **task** for *evaluation*:\n",
        "1. Fill in the dictionary `param_grid`, to find which L2 regularization strength improves your model the most.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment ends with a **reflection**:\n",
        "1. *Short answer* regarding applying assignment concepts to a real world classification evaluation situation."

Hyperparameter tuning enables us to adjust the hyperparameters of our model, specifically those not learned from the data, to optimize its performance. Below, you will use K-fold cross-validation on the training data to get an estimate of your model's performance. For this deliverable, **replace `classifier` with the classifier you want to improve. Then, complete `param_grid` for `C` (values closer to 0 = stronger regularization)** to find which L2 regularization strength improves your model the most.
